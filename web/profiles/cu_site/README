This repository contains the files specific to a Creighton site named "cu_site." These include a make file, three install profile files, and the site custom modules and themes. The directory structure for a site repository is shown below. These files are intended for running a single site from an install profile (i.e. not for sharing libraries, modules and themes in the sites/all directory).

      cu_site_module_1
      cu_site_module_2

After running the site make file, additional directories are added to the profile directory for libraries, contributed modules and themes, and shared Creighton custom modules and themes. The final profile directory structure is shown below.
